                <h1>Introduction</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">This tutorial explains how to import a new project into Git, make changes to it, and
                share changes with other developers.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If you are instead primarily interested in using Git to fetch a project, for example,
                to test the latest version, you may prefer to start with the first two chapters of The Git User’s
                Manual.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">First, note that you can get documentation for a command such as git log --graph with:
            </p>

            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">$ man git-log</div>
            <p class="paragraph">or:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">$ git help log</div>
            <p class="paragraph">With the latter, you can use the manual viewer of your choice; see git-help[1] for more
                information.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It is a good idea to introduce yourself to Git with your name and public email address
                before doing any operation. The easiest way to do so is:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
                <br>
                $ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com

                <h1>Importing a new project</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Assume you have a tarball project.tar.gz with your initial work. You can place it under
                Git revision control as follows.</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ tar xzf project.tar.gz
                <br>
                $ cd project
                <br>
                $ git init

            <p class="paragraph">You’ve now initialized the working directory—​you may notice a new directory created,
                named ".git".</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Next, tell Git to take a snapshot of the contents of all files under the current
                directory (note the .), with git add:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">$ git add .</div>
            <p class="paragraph">This snapshot is now stored in a temporary staging area which Git calls the "index".
                You can permanently store the contents of the index in the repository with git commit:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">$ git commit</div>
            <p class="paragraph">This will prompt you for a commit message. You’ve now stored the first version of your
                project in Git.</p>

            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ git add file1 file2 file3
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">You are now ready to commit. You can see what is about to be committed using git diff
                with the --cached option:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">$ git diff --cached</div>
            <p class="paragraph">(Without --cached, git diff will show you any changes that you’ve made but not yet
                added to the index.) You can also get a brief summary of the situation with git status:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">$ git status
                <br>
                On branch master
                <br>
                Changes to be committed:
                <br>
                Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modified:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file1
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modified:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file2
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modified:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file3
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">If you need to make any further adjustments, do so now, and then add any newly modified
                content to the index. Finally, commit your changes with:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">$ git commit</div>
            <p class="paragraph">This will again prompt you for a message describing the change, and then record a new
                version of the project.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Alternatively, instead of running git add beforehand, you can use</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">$ git commit -a</div>
            <p class="paragraph">which will automatically notice any modified (but not new) files, add them to the
                index, and commit, all in one step.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><span class="paragraph__note">A note on commit messages:</span> Though not required,
                it’s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character) line
                summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up to
                the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used
                throughout Git. For example, git-format-patch turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on the
                Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.</p>

                <h1>Managing branches</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Suppose that Alice has started a new project with a Git repository in
                /home/alice/project, and that Bob, who has a home directory on the same machine, wants to contribute.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Bob begins with:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">bob$ git clone /home/alice/project myrepo</div>
            <p class="paragraph">This creates a new directory "myrepo" containing a clone of Alice’s repository. The
                clone is on an equal footing with the original project, possessing its own copy of the original
                project’s history.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Bob then makes some changes and commits them:</p>

            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                (edit files)
                <br>
                bob$ git commit -a
                <br>
                (repeat as necessary)
            </div>


            <p class="paragraph">When he’s ready, he tells Alice to pull changes from the repository at
                /home/bob/myrepo. She does this with:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                alice$ cd /home/alice/project
                <br>
                alice$ git pull /home/bob/myrepo master
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">This merges the changes from Bob’s "master" branch into Alice’s current branch. If
                Alice has made her own changes in the meantime, then she may need to manually fix any conflicts.</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">$ git branch</div>
            <p class="paragraph">The "pull" command thus performs two operations: it fetches changes from a remote
                branch, then merges them into the current branch.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Note that in general, Alice would want her local changes committed before initiating
                this "pull". If Bob’s work conflicts with what Alice did since their histories forked, Alice will use
                her working tree and the index to resolve conflicts, and existing local changes will interfere with the
                conflict resolution process (Git will still perform the fetch but will refuse to merge --- Alice will
                have to get rid of her local changes in some way and pull again when this happens).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Alice can peek at what Bob did without merging first, using the "fetch" command; this
                allows Alice to inspect what Bob did, using a special symbol "FETCH_HEAD", in order to determine if he
                has anything worth pulling, like this:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                alice$ git fetch /home/bob/myrepo master
                <br>
                alice$ git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">This operation is safe even if Alice has uncommitted local changes. The range notation
                "HEAD..FETCH_HEAD" means "show everything that is reachable from the FETCH_HEAD but exclude anything
                that is reachable from HEAD". Alice already knows everything that leads to her current state (HEAD), and
                reviews what Bob has in his state (FETCH_HEAD) that she has not seen with this command.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If Alice wants to visualize what Bob did since their histories forked she can issue the
                following command:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">$ gitk HEAD..FETCH_HEAD</div>
            <p class="paragraph">This uses the same two-dot range notation we saw earlier with git log.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Alice may want to view what both of them did since they forked. She can use three-dot
                form instead of the two-dot form:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ gitk HEAD...FETCH_HEAD
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">This means "show everything that is reachable from either one, but exclude anything
                that is reachable from both of them".</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Please note that these range notation can be used with both gitk and "git log".</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After inspecting what Bob did, if there is nothing urgent, Alice may decide to continue
                working without pulling from Bob. If Bob’s history does have something Alice would immediately need,
                Alice may choose to stash her work-in-progress first, do a "pull", and then finally unstash her
                work-in-progress on top of the resulting history.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When you are working in a small closely knit group, it is not unusual to interact with
                the same repository over and over again. By defining remote repository shorthand, you can make it
                easier:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">alice$ git remote add bob /home/bob/myrepo</div>
            <p class="paragraph">With this, Alice can perform the first part of the "pull" operation alone using the git
                fetch command without merging them with her own branch, using:</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Alice may want to view what both of them did since they forked. She can use three-dot
                form instead of the two-dot form:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                alice$ git fetch bob
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Unlike the longhand form, when Alice fetches from Bob using a remote repository
                shorthand set up with git remote, what was fetched is stored in a remote-tracking branch, in this case
                <span class="code code--small">bob/master</span>. So after this:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">alice$ git log -p master..bob/master</div>
            <p class="paragraph">shows a list of all the changes that Bob made since he branched from Alice’s master
                branch.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After examining those changes, Alice could merge the changes into her master branch:
            </p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                alice$ git merge bob/master
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">This <span class="code code--small">merge</span> can also be done by pulling from her
                own remote-tracking branch, like this:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">alice$ git pull . remotes/bob/master</div>
            <p class="paragraph">Note that git pull always merges into the current branch, regardless of what else is
                given on the command line.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Later, Bob can update his repo with Alice’s latest changes using</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                bob$ git pull
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Note that he doesn’t need to give the path to Alice’s repository; when Bob cloned
                Alice’s repository, Git stored the location of her repository in the repository configuration, and that
                location is used for pulls:</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Please note that these range notation can be used with both gitk and "git log".</p>

            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                bob$ git config --get remote.origin.url
                <br>
                /home/alice/project
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">(The complete configuration created by git clone is visible using <span
                    class="code code--small">git config -l</span>, and the git-config man page explains the meaning of
                each option.)</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Git also keeps a pristine copy of Alice’s master branch under the name "origin/master":
            </p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                bob$ git branch -r
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;origin/master
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Alternatively, Git has a native protocol, or can use http; see git-pull for details.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Git can also be used in a CVS-like mode, with a central repository that various users
                push changes to; see git-push and gitcvs-migration.</p>

                <h1>Exploring history</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Git history is represented as a series of interrelated commits. We have already seen that the git log command can list those commits. Note that first line of each git log entry also gives a name for the commit:</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">

                commit c82a22c39cbc32576f64f5c6b3f24b99ea8149c7

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">We can give this name to git show to see the details about this commit.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Bob then makes some changes and commits them:</p>

            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ git show c82a22c39cbc32576f64f5c6b3f24b99ea8149c
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">But there are other ways to refer to commits. You can use any initial part of the name
                that is long enough to uniquely identify the commit:</p>
            <pre class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
$ git show c82a22c39c	# the first few characters of the name are
                        # usually enough
$ git show HEAD		# the tip of the current branch
$ git show experimental	# the tip of the "experimental" branch
                </pre>
            <p class="paragraph">Every commit usually has one "parent" commit which points to the previous state of the
                project:</p>
            <pre class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
$ git show HEAD^  # to see the parent of HEAD
$ git show HEAD^^ # to see the grandparent of HEAD
$ git show HEAD~4 # to see the great-great grandparent of HEAD
                </pre>
            <p class="paragraph">Note that merge commits may have more than one parent:</p>
            <pre class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
$ git show HEAD^1 # show the first parent of HEAD (same as HEAD^)
$ git show HEAD^2 # show the second parent of HEAD
                </pre>
            <p class="paragraph">You can also give commits names of your own; after running</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ git tag v2.5 1b2e1d63ff
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">you can refer to 1b2e1d63ff by the name "v2.5". If you intend to share this name with
                other people (for example, to identify a release version), you should create a "tag" object, and perhaps
                sign it; see git-tag[1] for details.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Any Git command that needs to know a commit can take any of these names. For example:
            </p>
            <pre class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
$ git diff v2.5 HEAD	 # compare the current HEAD to v2.5
$ git branch stable v2.5 # start a new branch named "stable" based
                         # at v2.5
$ git reset --hard HEAD^ # reset your current branch and working
                         # directory to its state at HEAD^
                </pre>
            <p class="paragraph">Be careful with that last command: in addition to losing any changes in the working
                directory, it will also remove all later commits from this branch. If this branch is the only branch
                containing those commits, they will be lost. Also, don’t use git reset on a publicly-visible branch that
                other developers pull from, as it will force needless merges on other developers to clean up the
                history. If you need to undo changes that you have pushed, use git revert instead.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The git grep command can search for strings in any version of your project, so</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ git grep "hello" v2.5
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">searches for all occurrences of "hello" in v2.5.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If you leave out the commit name, git grep will search any of the files it manages in
                your current directory. So</p>

            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ git grep "hello"
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">is a quick way to search just the files that are tracked by Git.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Many Git commands also take sets of commits, which can be specified in a number of
                ways. Here are some examples with git log:</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Any Git command that needs to know a commit can take any of these names. For example:
            </p>
            <pre class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
$ git log v2.5..v2.6            # commits between v2.5 and v2.6
$ git log v2.5..                # commits since v2.5
$ git log --since="2 weeks ago" # commits from the last 2 weeks
$ git log v2.5.. Makefile       # commits since v2.5 which modify
                                # Makefile
                </pre>
            <p class="paragraph">You can also give git log a "range" of commits where the first is not necessarily an
                ancestor of the second; for example, if the tips of the branches "stable" and "master" diverged from a
                common commit some time ago, then</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ git log stable..master
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">will list commits made in the master branch but not in the stable branch, while</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ git log master..stable
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">will show the list of commits made on the stable branch but not the master branch.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The git log command has a weakness: it must present commits in a list. When the history
                has lines of development that diverged and then merged back together, the order in which git log
                presents those commits is meaningless.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Most projects with multiple contributors (such as the Linux kernel, or Git itself) have
                frequent merges, and gitk does a better job of visualizing their history. For example,</p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ gitk --since="2 weeks ago" drivers/
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">allows you to browse any commits from the last 2 weeks of commits that modified files
                under the "drivers" directory. (Note: you can adjust gitk’s fonts by holding down the control key while
                pressing "-" or "+".)</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Finally, most commands that take filenames will optionally allow you to precede any
                filename by a commit, to specify a particular version of the file:</p>

            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ git diff v2.5:Makefile HEAD:Makefile.in
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">You can also use git show to see any such file: </p>
            <div class="code u-margin-bottom-medium">
                $ git show v2.5:Makefile
            </div>
        </div>
    </main>
